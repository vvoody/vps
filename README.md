vps
===
There are some scripts, programs and configuration files to help
initialize vps quickly.

Mainly, this project concerns Slackware, but it may help somehow.

Since I've got a few VPS installed with Ubuntu, now this project is
concerning both Slackware and Ubuntu. And Ubuntu will be managed with
the help of Puppet.
