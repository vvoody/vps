* Install Puppet

*Ubuntu 10.04:*
 - apt-get install ruby rubygems1.8         # Ruby 1.8.7
 - apt-get install libopenssl-ruby          # if not installed
 - export PATH=$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin

*Ubuntu 12.04:*
 - apt-get install ruby rubygems   # Ruby 1.8.7, precise only has 1.9.1
                                   # which is not supported by Puppet 3

*Then:*
 - gem install puppet

Ubuntu 10.04 and 12.04 don't have latest deb package for Puppet(3.0.1
currently). Fortunately, they do both have Ruby 1.8.7 which is
supported by Puppet 3, so command 'gem install ruby' can help us get
latest Puppet.
